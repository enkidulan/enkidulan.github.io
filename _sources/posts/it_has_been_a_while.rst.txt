My blog is back
===============

It has been a while! But my blog is back and on a new engine!

After a mishap with a cloud provider, I'm bringing my blog back. This time I've decided to try static blog engine, and even more, the one that is based on Sphinx. Thanks to https://ablog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for awesome software.
